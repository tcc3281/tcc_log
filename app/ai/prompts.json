Recognize database question\n2. Write appropriate SQL\n3. Execute sql_query tool IMMEDIATELY\n4. Present real results\n5. Explain findings\n\n### Database Question Recognition:\nAny question containing:\n- \"how many [table_name]\"\n- \"show me [data]\"\n- \"count of [something]\"\n- \"list [database_content]\"\n- References to tables in the schema\n→ IMMEDIATE sql_query execution required",
